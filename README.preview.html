<h1>PyImgRec</h1>

<h2>Python image recognition.</h2>

<p>The GUI Drives the 'C' imgrec python extension. Not all aspects are ported to 'C',
but they are easily doable.</p>

<p>Used to work on python 2 ... ported it to python 3</p>

<p>GNU / Linux:</p>

<p>Usual (autoconf) ./configure and make cycle works</p>

<h2>How it works:</h2>

<p>A flood fill algorithm is extended to emit coordinates of the flood fill terminal points.
This creates a 2 dimensional array that follows the object outline.</p>

<p>This outline is then normalized by array size and magnitude, creating a uniform structure,
ideal for shape comparison.  (See: algorithm/norm_outline.py)</p>

<p>This is all happening in ONE pass. Perfect algorithm for embedded solutions.</p>

<h2>Edge / Outline detection:</h2>

<h2>Practical example</h2>

<p>The image below is a real world example. The outline is clearly recognizable
by the shape comparison algorithm.</p>

<p><img src="elephant.png" alt="Elephant" title="" /></p>

<h2>Another example</h2>

<p>No, this is not a suggestion, but a possibility. In a single pass we got the following:</p>

<p><img src="tank.png" alt="Tank" title="" /></p>

<p>// EOF</p>
